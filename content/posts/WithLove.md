*With Love* is a short visual novel developed over the course of 3 weeks. You take yourself on a solo roadtrip around New England, visiting 5 locations in any order. During these stops, there's no dialogue or character interactions. Instead, the story unfolds through postcards you write from each location, personalized for the specific decisions you make on your trip.
