      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;bull in a china shop?&amp;rdquo; These five words were the inspiration behind &lt;em&gt;BreakaBull&lt;/em&gt;, a VR game where you play as a bull running a tea shop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[INSERT BULL]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-breakabull&#34;&gt;Why BreakaBull?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BreakaBull&lt;/em&gt; is a cozy game, but it also has a unique level of difficulty to it. Since you play as a bull, you have to do everything with your hooves. This can range from making tea and serving customers to sweeping and doing soothing chores around the tea shop. Seems simple enough, right? But the difficulty lies with the hooves— without the luxury of opposable thumbs, every task requires careful consideration and grace. Gameplay is focused on navigating a world that isn&amp;rsquo;t built for you, but without any stressful stakes. Do your best to appease the clientele— or don&amp;rsquo;t. We won&amp;rsquo;t tell.&#xA;Every day, customers will come into the tea shop. They&amp;rsquo;re unique, too— each customer has their own backstory and will talk to you about their day, their past, their hopes and dreams&amp;hellip; every one of them is their own &lt;del&gt;person&lt;/del&gt; animal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart of the Cards&lt;/em&gt; was born from the intersection of dating sims and deckbuilders. For this 3-month project, our team worked to bring the idea to life. Unfortunately, things fell through, and in the end, the project ended up feeling incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[INSERT KETCHUP RESPONSE]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-intention&#34;&gt;Our Intention&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to create something that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been done before. The team was heavy on narrative specialists, and so we absolutely needed to have fun characters and an interesting story. Our game idea was formed fairly quickly, and the team was excited about the prospect of &lt;em&gt;Heart of the Cards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
